Write a complete, spoken real estate ad script for the following property. This script will be read aloud by a presenter in a video ad (similar to a social media real estate creator style).

PROPERTY DETAILS:
- Name: ${propertyName}
- Location: ${location}
- Type: ${type || "Luxury Residential"}
- Size/Configuration: ${size || "Premium layouts"}
- Price / Rent / Tariff (as per listing type): ${price || "Premium pricing"}
- Key USPs / Features:
${uspsList}
- Call-to-Action: ${cta}

LANGUAGE: English (Indian real-estate influencer style)
TONE: ${toneInstruction}
LISTING TYPE: ${transactionInstruction}

IMPORTANT - TAILOR TO THE PROPERTY TYPE ("${type || "Luxury Residential"}") AND LISTING TYPE ABOVE: a plot/land ad sells location, investment and appreciation (no rooms/BHK/amenities talk); a shop or commercial space sells footfall, visibility and ROI; a farmhouse sells space, greenery and a weekend-getaway feel; a banquet hall sells capacity and events; a hotel or homestay sells the stay experience and easy booking. Never force apartment-style luxury framing onto a type it doesn't fit.

SCRIPT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Length: 60–75 words TOTAL - this is a fast 30-SECOND reel, NOT a long ad. The whole script must be comfortably speakable in about 30 seconds at a natural pace. Never exceed 75 words. Every word must earn its place - cut anything that isn't a hook, a top selling point, or the CTA.
2. Structure: a punchy HOOK, then just 2–3 standout highlights (include the exact figure if one was given), then one strong closing CTA line. The pipeline splits the script into Part 1 (hook, ~15s) and Part 2 (highlights + CTA, ~15s), so keep the two halves roughly balanced and each easily speakable in 15 seconds.
3. Write in SPOKEN language - short punchy sentences, not formal prose
4. Include natural pauses implied through sentence breaks
5. Make it feel like a confident real-estate creator speaking to camera, not an AI
6. Use ellipsis (…) naturally for dramatic pauses where appropriate
7. DO NOT include stage directions, timestamps, or any formatting - pure spoken text only
8. End with a clear, compelling call-to-action
9. THE FIGURE IS NON-NEGOTIABLE: if a figure was given (${price || "none given"}), state that exact figure verbatim wherever it is mentioned, described according to the LISTING TYPE above (sale price / monthly rent / per-night tariff). Do NOT invent, round, discount, or substitute any other number. If none was given, do not mention any specific price, rent, or tariff figure at all.

EXAMPLE STYLE & LENGTH (a ~30-second M3M Opus ad - match this LENGTH, pacing and energy; ignore any numbers in it):
"When Gurgaon talks about ultra-luxury living… M3M Opus sets a new benchmark. A standalone, low-density tower - Singaporean-style boutique luxury, right on Golf Course Extension Road. Four-side open layouts with sweeping 270-degree views of the skyline and the Aravalli Hills. Homes priced at seven crore onwards. But hurry - inventory is limited. Book your private site visit today… just tap the link below."

(This example is a luxury apartment FOR SALE and is deliberately short - about 30 seconds, ~65 words. Match its LENGTH and energy, but adapt the actual angle to THIS property's type and listing type.)

Write the script now, using the exact figure given. Return ONLY the spoken script text with no headers, no labels, no formatting.`;

RULES:
1. Write out ALL numbers as words, fully and consistently in the script's own language: ${numberWordExample}. English brand/technical terms like "BHK" or "sqft" may stay in English even inside an otherwise non-English number phrase, but the number word itself (one/two/four/thousand/hazaar/etc.) must be entirely in one language - never split a single number across two languages.
2. Expand ALL abbreviations: "sqft" → "square feet", "BR" → "bedroom", "yr" → "year", "yrs" → "years", "approx" → "approximately"
3. Remove currency symbols - write them as words: "₹" → nothing (just say the number and crore/lakh), "$" → "dollars"
4. KEEP every "…" exactly as-is - it is a soft dramatic pause within continuous flowing speech, not a sentence break. Do NOT convert it into a period or a new sentence; ElevenLabs pronounces "…" natively as a brief pause without a full stop. Only replace " - " with a comma (never a period, to avoid adding unintended hard stops).
5. Keep proper nouns, project names, and location names exactly as-is (do not change spelling of names).
6. Keep the same language and tone - do NOT translate or rephrase content. Only fix pronunciation-unsafe characters and abbreviations.
7. Return ONLY the cleaned script text. No labels, no headers, no explanation.
