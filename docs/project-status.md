# Thumbpin Platform - Project Status (April 28, 2026)

This document summarizes the current platform state based strictly on implemented code in this repository. It lists what is live in the codebase, how it works today, and the near-term scope without exaggeration.

---

## 1) Current Stage

**Stage:** Active development with core generation flows implemented and credit enforcement centralized.

**What’s in place:**
- Multiple generation pipelines (video, image, avatar) with real provider integrations.
- Unified credit system, including free starter quota, paid credits, and refunds on failure.
- Razorpay order creation + webhook handling (with signature verification and idempotency).
- Core dashboard pages and public landing pages.

---

## 2) Implemented User Experience (Current)

### Authentication & User Profile
- Email/password login and Google OAuth sign-in.
- User profile API returns stored credits and plan.

### Dashboard & App Pages
- **Credits page** shows current credit balance and free quota usage.
- **Profile page** shows plan and credit balance.
- **Generate flows** available under `/app/*` routes for video, image, product-video, real-estate video, AI walkthrough, and UGC creator workflows.

### Credit Display & Messaging
- Free tier messaging reflects **2 video + 2 avatar** free generations.
- Credits badge and upgrade banner read from canonical `plan` and `credits` fields.

- Product video generation (Gemini Veo, SSE streaming, asset saved).
- Real-estate video generation (Gemini Veo, SSE streaming, asset saved).

**Provider coverage in code:**
- Kling, Runway, Luma, Pika, Minimax, Gemini Veo.

### 3.2 Avatar Generation

**Supported avatar flows (live in API):**
- Gemini-based avatar image generation for product videos.

### 3.3 Image Generation

**Supported image flows (live in API):**
- DALL-E 3

## 4) Credit System (Implemented)

### Free Tier Policy (Active)
- **Paid credits at signup:** 0
- **Free video quota:** 2
- **Free avatar quota:** 2

### Credit Engine (Centralized)
- All major generation endpoints now call the centralized credit engine.
- Credits are debited before provider calls.
- On failures, credits or free quota slots are refunded.
- Transactions are logged for auditability.

### Credit Costs (Active)
| Action | Cost | Free Bucket |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| generate_video | 2 | video |
| text_to_video | 2 | video |
| image_to_video | 2 | video |
| ai_walkthrough | 2 | video |
| product_video | 1 | video |
| real_estate_video | 3 | video |
| product_avatar_image | 1 | avatar |
| image_generation | 1 | - |
| gemini_image_generation | 1 | - |

---

## 5) Payments & Billing (Implemented)

### Credit Packs
- Server-defined packs are enforced.
- Order creation requires authenticated user session.
- Client cannot submit arbitrary amounts.

### Razorpay Webhook
- Signature verification enforced.
- Webhook idempotency prevents double crediting.
- Payment capture adds credits.
- Subscription activation sets plan to `pro` and adds recharge credits.

---

## 6) Platform Assets & Data

### Asset Library
- Generated outputs are saved into `Asset` records with metadata.

### Data Models Used
- `User`
- `Asset`
- `Video`
- `CreditTransaction`
- `WebhookEvent`

---

## 7) What Is NOT Fully Wired Yet (Known Gaps)

These are present in code but not fully connected end-to-end in the UI:

- Credits page currently simulates Razorpay checkout; full frontend checkout integration is pending.
- Ledger admin/reconciliation UI is not built yet.
- Existing users created before this change may require migration for new quota fields.

---

## 8) Future Scope (Based on Current Architecture)

These are sensible next steps that align with current structure but are **not implemented yet**:

1. **Production checkout wiring**
   - Trigger `/api/create-order` from Credits UI.
   - Launch Razorpay checkout using the returned order.

2. **Credit ledger dashboard**
   - Admin view to audit `CreditTransaction` history.
   - Filters by user and action type.

3. **Subscription lifecycle support**
   - Handle recurring monthly recharges.
   - Graceful downgrade/expiry handling.

4. **Backfill & migration**
   - Update existing user records with `freeVideoGenerationsUsed` and `freeAvatarGenerationsUsed`.

5. **Monitoring & alerts**
   - Track refund rates and provider error spikes.

---

## 9) Summary

The platform currently has production-grade generation APIs, centralized credit enforcement, and secure payment processing via Razorpay. The free starter quota is now **2 videos + 2 avatars**, enforced at the backend. UI messaging has been aligned to this policy. The primary remaining work is wiring the actual Razorpay checkout flow in the frontend and adding admin reconciliation/observability.
