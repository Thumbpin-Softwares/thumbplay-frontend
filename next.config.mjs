  // Marking them external (rather than manually listing files via
  // outputFileTracingIncludes) lets Next's own file tracer follow their real
  // require graph and resolve pnpm's symlinked node_modules structure itself -
  // hand-picking globs into node_modules/.pnpm ends up including the symlinked
  // directories verbatim, which Vercel's packaging step rejects outright.
